`Spotify Sort Qwik` is a TypeScript port of Spotify Sort, a utility to sort Spotify playlists

It is coded in the Qwik framework and it was designed using Figma, should work on mobile as well as desktop.

This is an improved version of SpotifySort-TS, which was coded in NextJS and used older libraries to interact with the Spotify API.

Both the site itself and Spotify Sort are vastly imrpoved from their original, yet the design and overall idea remain.
