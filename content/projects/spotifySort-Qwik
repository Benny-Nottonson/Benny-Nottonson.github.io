`Spotify Sort Qwik` is a TypeScript port of Spotify Sort, a utility to sort Spotify playlists

It is coded in the Qwik framework and it was designed using Figma and should work on mobile as well as desktop.

The runtime is significantly faster than the original Python version, and the UI is much more responsive.
It is a recoded version of an older port, coded in NextJS that used ThreeJS and Tailwind, but both were unecessary the former hindered page performance.
