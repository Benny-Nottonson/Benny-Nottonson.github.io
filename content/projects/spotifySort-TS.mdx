`Spotify Sort TS` is a TypeScript port of Spotify Sort, a utility to sort Spotify playlists

It is coded in NextJS, and uses tailwind-css and three.js to render 3d animations to the screen, it was designed using Figma and should work on mobile as well as desktop.

The runtime is significantly faster than the original Python version, and the UI is much more responsive.
