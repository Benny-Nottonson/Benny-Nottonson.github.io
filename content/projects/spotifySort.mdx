`Spotify Sort` is a Python utility intended to sort Spotify playlists by the color of their album covers. Using Color Coherency Vectors proved to be the most accurate, after applying loop sorting over multiple iterations to find the shortest overall distance between all vectors. A Self-Organization Map was originally used, but it was not efficient or accurate.

Spotify Sort is publically avaialable and should work on Python 3.9+
